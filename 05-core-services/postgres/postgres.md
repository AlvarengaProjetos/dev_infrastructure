### WHY SUPABASE POSTGRES FOR N8N ###

# We have chosen Supabase as the database for N8N because it provides a reliable data layer for our Docker Swarm setup.
# It offers a VERY generous free plan and is quick and easy to set up.
# Consider a Swarm cluster with three manager nodes: manager1, manager2, and manager3. 
# While it's bad practice for manager nodes to also run application workloads (they should ideally be dedicated to cluster management), let's assume this setup for this example.
# Initially, the N8N service is running on manager1, which is also the Swarm leader. If manager1 fails, the Swarm orchestrator will automatically promote a new leader (e.g., manager2) and reschedule the N8N containers to another node.
# Since the new containers connect to the same external Supabase database, they can resume operations seamlessly without data loss.
# This architecture ensures that even in the event of a node failure, the system maintains availability.
# I chose Supabase because it's easier to set up and allows for faster application deployment.
# But Supabase DOES NOT have true High Availability yet.
# If you require true High Availability from the database perspective to eliminate a single point of failure, you can use Azure or AWS services."

### HOW INTEGRATE SUPABASE INTO N8N STACK ###

# Database type (PostgreSQL)
- DB_TYPE=postgresdb    
# Database name
- DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=postgres
# Database host
- DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=SUPABASE_HOST
# Database port
- DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=SUPABASE_PORT
# Database user
- DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=SUPABASE_USER
# Database password
- DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=SUPABASE_PASSWORD
# Database schema
- DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA=YOUR_SUPABASE_SCHEMA

### DB_TYPE ### 
# Description: The database type used by n8n.
# Value: postgresdb (fixed value)

### DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE ### 
# Description: The name of the PostgreSQL database.
# Default: postgres (commonly used by Supabase)

### DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST ### 
# Description: The Supabase PostgreSQL host address. Replace with the actual host from your Supabase project settings.
# Format: aws-0-[REGION].pooler.supabase.com

### DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT ### 
# Description: The port used to connect to the Supabase PostgreSQL database.
# While both 5432 and 6543 may work, Supabase documentation recommends using 5432 for direct connections (ideal for virtual machines or server-based deployments).
# Recommended Value: 5432
- DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=SUPABASE_PORTS

### DB_POSTGRESDB_USERr ### 
# Description: The database user provided by Supabase. Found in your Supabase project under database settings.
# Format: postgres.[SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID]

### DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD ### 
# Description: The password associated with your Supabase database user.
# Available in your Supabase dashboard under: 
# https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/database/

### DB_POSTGRESDB_SCHEMA ### 
# Description: The PostgreSQL schema to be used by n8n. You must create this schema manually.
# my_n8n_database with your desired schema name.
# Replace my_n8n_database with your desired schema name.
CREATE SCHEMA my_n8n_database AUTHORIZATION postgres;
