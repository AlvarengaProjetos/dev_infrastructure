docker pull cloudflare/cloudflared:latest

# Deploy the Cloudflared stack using the cloudflared.yaml file
# prune: removes services that are no longer referenced in the compose file
# detach=false: runs in the foreground so you can see the output
# resolve-image always: ensures the image is pulled and updated if needed
# -c cloudflared.yaml: specifies the Compose file to use
# cloudflared: the name of the stack
